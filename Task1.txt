Question: Which loop system would be better for user input. Justify your answer by creating a program that takes a value and adds it to a variable and prints it repeatedly until the user enters a zero value.

Answer: In C, a while loop is better for this scenario because we donâ€™t know the number of iterations in advance. It allows us to repeatedly take user input, update a variable, and exit the loop when the user enters zero.

Example:

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	int num;
	do{
	printf("Please enter a number other than zero: ");
	scanf("%d", &num);
	if (num==0){
	printf("Loop terminated as number is zero");
		   }
	  }
	while(num!=0);
	  }
